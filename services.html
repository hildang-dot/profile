      <strong>Symptoms:</strong> TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) light
      illuminated on dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tools Needed:</strong> Tire pressure gauge, access to air pump
      (gas station).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Find your car's recommended tire pressure (usually on a sticker inside
        the driver's door jamb or in the manual).
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a tire pressure gauge to check the pressure in all four tires.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add air to the tires until they reach the recommended PSI. Do not
        overinflate.
      </li>

    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>When to Call a Mechanic:</strong> Light stays on after inflation,
      frequent low pressure in the same tire (could indicate a slow leak),
      visual puncture in the tire.
